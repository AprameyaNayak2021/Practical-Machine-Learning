# Weight Lifting Exercise Prediction Project


## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here:

(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Project Overview :
This project aims to predict the manner in which participants performed barbell lifts using data from accelerometers placed on various parts of their bodies. The goal is to classify the "classe" variable, which indicates whether the exercise was performed correctly or incorrectly in one of five different ways. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, cross-validation, and performance metrics to predict these movements accurately.

## Files Included in the Repository:
      1) pml-training.csv: Training dataset used to build and evaluate the prediction model.
      2) pml-testing.csv: Test dataset used for making final predictions.
      3) Practical Machine Learning.Rmd: R Markdown file containing the analysis, model building, cross-validation, and predictions.
      4) Practical-Machne-Learning.html: Compiled HTML version of the R Markdown file for easy viewing.
      5) Practical-Machne-Learning.md: a plain text file that uses Markdown language to format text.
      6) .gitignore file
      7) Practical-Machne-Learning.Rproj
      8) README.md: This document
